1) What methods would a class that implements the java.lang.CharSequence interface
   have to implement?
   
    subSequence(int start, int end)
	length()
	charAt(int index)
	
	
2) What is wrong with the following interface?

    public interface SomethingIsWrong {
       
      void aMethod(int aValue){
        System.out.println("Hi Mom");
      }
    }
    in interface method implementation is not possible 
    

3) Fix the interface in question 2.

 public interface SomethingIsWrong {
       
      void aMethod(int aValue);
    }

4) Is the following interface valid?
   
   public interface Marker {
   
   }
   yes
